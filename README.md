# Codes-for-optimal-irreversible-monetary-policy
**Codes for “Optimal irreversible monetary policy,” by K. Hasui, T. Kobayashi, and T. Sugo, European Economic Review. (This version: Feb 2021)**

**Main files:**
* plot_figures2and3.m
* plot_figure4.m
* plot_figures5and6.m
*	plot_figure7.m
*	plot_figures8and9.m
*	plot_figure10.m
These codes plot figures in the paper loading matfiles.

**Function and simulation files:**
*	result_derive.m: This code solves the model recalling the following Matlab function and produces matfiles.
*	nkmodel_irrev.m / objective_irrev.m: Matlab function of NK model with reversal aversion.
*	matfiles: Result files produced by result_derive.m.

To run program codes, you must have CompEcon Toolbox (qnwnorm.m / discrand.m) for Matlab (available at http://www4.ncsu.edu/~pfackler/compecon).

**Data:**
